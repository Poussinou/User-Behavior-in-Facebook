		<h3>How do we preserve your privacy?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Your data will be collected without your identity
			(e.g. we know that "<i>someone</i>" liked some post, but we cannot know who did that).</p>
		<p>Furthermore, your data is accumulated with the data of other participants.
			The collected data will be encoded using hash algorithms (i.e. your data is not reversible)
			which means that the database of FPWA plugin will contain just the hashed data.</p>
			<p>Our source code is available <a href="https://github.com/abozanona/User-Behavior-in-Facebook" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Why do we collect the aforementioned data about you and other volunteers?</h3>
		<br>

		<p>We need (and use) your data only for academic/research purposes.
			In particular the objective of our study is twofold:</p>

		<p><strong>First, <i>evaluating data exposure in Facebook. </i> </strong> <br>
			The huge set of functionalities Facebook offering to their users attracts lots
			of people from different age rages to join Facebook. This will make them
			vulnerable to different kinds of risks. Protecting personal data means a lot to most Facebook users.
			Therefore, we provide a simple (color-based) mechanism that will help our volunteers to set their
			privacy settings in a way that limit private data exposure.</p>

		<p><strong>Second, <i>understanding user behavior in Facebook. </i> </strong> <br>
			User behavior in Facebook is a critical issue for different parties. For example, authors of alternative online
			social networks architectures to make well-founded design choices, and Facebook itself,
			because understanding user behavior impacts their design choices in Facebook, and help them provide
			the most appropriate functions and features to that user. In addition to that, user behavior in
			Facebook may concern the user itself, for example, the user might be eager
			to know statistics about his/her usage of Facebook because he could spend a lot
			of his time on Facebook at the expense of his duty and responsibilities in the
			life. These statistics may include: the most Facebook functionalities used,
			the time user spend on Facebook, or even the time user spend on a specific
			functionality, and much more of statistics that can be measured.</p>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Our study is an extension of a <a href="https://fba.ppu.edu/previous_work.html" target="_blank">previous work</a>.</p>

		<h3>How can you benefit from FPWA?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>First of all, FPWA helps you to better customize your privacy settings in Facebook.
			It provides an innovative interface to overlook and change privacy on Facebook easily.
			The basic idea is that people can gather information more easily when it is associated with colors.
			In the profile page of Facebook and were linked with colors.
			The idea is inspired from <a href="http://www.daniel-puscher.de/fpw/" target="_blank">FPW</a>.</p>
					
		<p>Second, once we collect sufficient amount of data about you and other volunteers,
			you will be able to see information and statistics about your behavior in Facebook.
			Furthermore, you can compare your behavior to the behavior of other volunteers.
			<i>In addition, more features are being developed.</i></p>
