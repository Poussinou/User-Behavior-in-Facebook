		<h3>How do we preserve your privacy</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Your data will be collected without your identity (e.g. we know that "<i>someone</i>" liked some post,
			but we cannot know who did that).</p>
		<p>Furthermore, your data is accumulated with the data of other participants.
		The collected data will be encoded using hash algorithms (i.e. Your data is not reversible)
		which means that the database of FPWA plugin will contain just the hashed data.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h3>Why do we collect the aforementioned data about you and other volunteers?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>We need (and use) your data only in academic/research purposes.
			In particular, the objectives of our study is twofold:</p>
		<li><i><b>Private Data Exposure in Facebook</b></i>
			<p>The huge set of functionalities Facebook offering to their users
				attracts lots of people from different age ranges to join Facebook.</p>
				<p>This will make them vulnerable to different kinds risks. Among these, privacy. Protecting personal
				data means a lot to most Facebook users. Even though most of them do not know how to set the right way.</p>
				<p>In this research, we will use the plugin FPWA that will help them set their privacy settings
				in a way that limit private data exposure.</p></li>
		<li><i><b>Understanding User Behavior in Facebook</b></i>
			<p>The behavior of Facebookers is critical for Facebook company itself,
				and for the users too. For example, the user might be eager	to know statistics about his/her usage of Facebook
				because he could spend a lot of his time on OSNs 	at the expense of his duty and responsibilities in the life.</p>
				<p>These statistics may include: the most Facebook functionalities used, the time user spend on Facebook,
				or even the time user spend on a specific functionality, and much more of statistics that can be measured.</p> </li>

		<hr/>
		<h3>How can you benefit from FPWA?</h3>
		<br>
		<p><b>First</b> of all, FPWA helps you to better customize your privacy settings in Facebook.</p>
		<p>By using <i>Coloring Posts</i> option, the user will notice that his/her posts on newsfeed in the main page of Facebook
			will be colored with a specific colors depending on the type of post privacy from the publisher,
			this will increase the user attention about his privacy level and with whom he/she sharing his/her daily activities and news.</p>
		<p><b>Second</b> FPWA gives you information about your behavior on Facebook. It also compares your behavior with other users.
			<i>Next updates via Chrome Store will contain more advantages for the end user.</i></p>
