          <p class="lead">Our Android application works as follows: </p> 
          <div class="row">

                <p>
                  The application launches a web view to load Facebook page in it, Facebook links are the only links to be loaded into that web view.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two Facebook pages are to be loaded into that web view, first page is the login page, this page appears when the user first start the application,
                  to ask him to log into his Facebook account, after log in a new cookie will be stored into the web view called C_User,
                  this cookie is used to know if the user is logged in or not, if the user is logged in, the app move him to another page,
                  which has the history of what we collected about him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  User_id can be found in the C_User cookie as well; this id is to be stored in the storage of the application.
                  The application opens the activity log of the Facebook user account, the activity log consists of group of filters,
                  for example there is filters for friends, likes, pages, and many other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some filters may exist in one Facebook account and not appear in another one, examples of these filters include filters
                  of the apps used by Facebook user, such that each app has its own filter. Data is collected from these filters every day;
                  such that every half-hour data of one filter is to be collected by opening the link of that filter associated with User_id.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The collected data is then stored into a local database to be sent later to the server.
                  The time of the action and the content in which the action happened to are stored also, for example,
                  if the user liked something, the time of the like is stored, and the content that has been liked is also stored
                  along with hash value of the user id. The application collects the actions that happened three days earlier,
                  which means that the collected data of one day was generated three days before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The privacy of the collected data is preserved by hashing any number appears and removing any user name
                  and any values that maybe leads to your identity on Facebook.
